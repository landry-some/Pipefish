# README for the docs folder

## Introduction

The `docs` folder contains supplementary information about the Charm programming language besides the introduction contained in [the main README file](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/README.md).

## Contents of the `docs` folder

* [Charm: a high-level view](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/charm-a-high-level-view.md). This explains the goals and design principles of the language.
* [Style guide](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/style-guide.md). This gives best practices for the style in which one should write Charm code.
* [Writing an adventure game in Charm](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/writing-an-adventure-game-in-charm.md). A tutorial.
* [Functional core, imperative shell](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/functional-core-imperative-shell.md). A synopsis of the language paradigm.
* [The whys of Charm](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/the-whys-of-charm.md). This explains the reasoning behind some lower-level design choices which are sufficiently unusual as to need explanation.
* [Version 0.4: a working prototype](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Charm/blob/main/docs/working-prototype.md). This explains what I mean by calling this version a "working prototype".
