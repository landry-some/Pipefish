# README for the docs folder

## Introduction

The `docs` folder contains supplementary information about the Pipefish programming language besides the introduction contained in [the main README file](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/README.md) and [the wiki/manual](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/wiki).

## Contents of the `docs` folder

* [Pipefish: a high-level view](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/-a-high-level-view.md). This explains the goals and design principles of the language.
* [Style guide](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/style-guide.md). This gives best practices for the style in which one should write Pipefish code.
* [Functional core, imperative shell](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/functional-core-imperative-shell.md). A synopsis of the language paradigm.
* [The type system in theory](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/the-type-system-in-theory.md)
* [Tokenization rules](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/) The exact rules of what makes a well-formed identifier. You probably don't need to read this.
* [The whys of Pipefish](https://github.com/tim-hardcastle/Pipefish/blob/main/docs/the-whys-of-.md). This explains the reasoning behind some lower-level design choices which are sufficiently unusual as to need explanation.
